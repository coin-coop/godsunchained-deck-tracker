# Gods Unchained Deck Tracker

Windows Application for deck tracking in Gods Unchained TCG


# Setup

**1. Download the .zip folder**

The published version (ready to start - just unzip): [Published](https://github.com/coin-coop/godsunchained-deck-tracker/releases/download/0.0.2/Gods.Unchained.Deck.Tracker.v.0.0.2.zip)

**OR**

The source code (you need to build it first by yourself for e.g. in Visual Studio 2019): [Source code](https://github.com/coin-coop/godsunchained-deck-tracker/archive/0.0.2.zip)

**2. Launch the application by GodsUnchained-Deck-Tracker.exe**

**3. Change the path to your log directory**

![Log directory path setting](/Docs/sc1.png)

It will look similiar to this one:

```
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\LocalLow\FuelGames\Gods Unchained - Version 0.24.1.544(2020.7.23) - Built at 20_58_23\output_log_simple.txt
```

This popup will appear only during first startup. Later on you can change this path in the Settings menu.

**4. Wait until application will display all decks which you were using**

In fact it will display decks played since 29.06. I have constrained to this date as loading all decks which player ever played could take quiet long. Later I'm planning add more infos for easier recognize which deck is displayed (e.g. distribution of core/genesis/welcome set cards). For now you need to recognize by cards displayed.
 
**Note: First display of the decks can take up to 10 minutes!!! So please be patient on the first run.**

**5. Click on the chosen Deck**
 
It will load the application with your deck. The deck wil be displayed in the app.

**6. Start deck tracker**

Click button 'Start Tracker', after that will appear the separate half transparent window used for tracking drawn cards. To stop tracking click 'Stop Tracker'.
